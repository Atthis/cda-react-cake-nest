# CDA React Cake Nest project

## Context

This project has been created during a web developper course.
I have worked on a professionnal like context :

- use a kanban and tickets to structure features
- create PRs for each tickets
- deploy on a web service (Vercel)

## Goals

The goal is to train on the use of React, applied to a real world app with a professionnal context.

## Features
